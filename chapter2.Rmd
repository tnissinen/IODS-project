# Chapter 2: Regression and model validation

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods.
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using.

1.
The dataset contains 166 observations with 7 variables (gender ("M" = male/"F" = female), age, attitude toward statistics, avg. of deep learning grades, avg. of strategic learning grades, avg. of surface learning grades and total points).

2.

From the graphical overview of the data I made following observations:
- the distribution of age variable shows that there are more young people (close to their 20s) in the dataset 
- the total points are quite evenly distributed over all ages, however the highest points are achieved by people below 40.
- deep learning grades are higher than othe grades
- attitude seems to correlate heavily with points

3.

I chose Attitude, Age and Gender as explanatory variables:

Age and Gender doesn't seem to have statistically significant relationship with points, so I removed them.

4.

Attitude has an effect of about 0.35 to the total points with a standard error of about 0.057. Since the Pr value is close to zero, we can conclude that the attitude has a statistically significant relationship with the points.

The R-squared statistic provides a measure of how well the model is fitting the actual data. In multiple regression settings, the R2 will always increase as more variables are included in the model. Thatâ€™s why the adjusted R2 is the preferred measure as it adjusts for the number of variables considered

In this case the attitude has significant effect, but R squared value of 0.20 tells that it's clearly not the only factor. This can be also seen from the simple scatter plot of attitude vs. points.

Using a summary of your fitted model, explain the relationship between the chosen explanatory variables and the target variable (interpret the model parameters). Explain and interpret the multiple R squared of the model. (0-3 points)

5.

Produce the following diagnostic plots: Residuals vs Fitted values, Normal QQ-plot and Residuals vs Leverage. Explain the assumptions of the model and interpret the validity of those assumptions based on the diagnostic plots. (0-3 points)

![Graphical overview of the dataset](3plots.png)

We assume that the error in our model is normally distributed. The Q-Q plot shows that the normality assumption seems to hold reasonably well.

The constant variance assumption can be evaluated from the Residuals vs fitted plot. There is not a very clear pattern visible, so we can conclude that the assumption holds quite well. However, the spread seems to decrease a little towards the far end of the residuals, which might be a small problem.

The leverage plot shows that some observations have a little more leverage than most, but the relative difference is still quite small (0.01 vs. around 0.04)
